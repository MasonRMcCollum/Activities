// Create a while loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100 by following these steps...

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let x = 1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
while (x <= 100){
  console.log(x);
x++;
}
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
